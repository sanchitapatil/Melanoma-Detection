# Melanoma-Detection
This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect melanoma in images of skin lesions among 10 classes. The **Gradio** library is used to create an interactive web app for model prediction. The model achieves an **87% accuracy** in classifying the skin lesions.
